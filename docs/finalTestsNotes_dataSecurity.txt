I tested big dataset of 124.9 GB, and approximately 1/5 of that was the other dataset. I used both rmlint and rdfind tools as I was unable to configure VDO in set time. Both used tools are/can be under GLPv3 (one author allows for 2nd version or higher).
I used SanDisk Ultra® Dual Drive 128 GB USB Type-C with alleged 400 MB/s read speed (actual tested value ~370 MB/s), and since results of deduplication were out almost immediately, this means this drive was sufficient, otherwise I would need to switch to same NVMe as I used for bigger set to ensure same conditions. For bigger set I used WD_BLACK SN770 1TB, which was designed to preform at 4,900-5,150 MB/s read speed. Tests with hdparm showed ~2600 MB/s but actual performance of dedup was several times higher than that when peaking but average at first sight was not, or rather, it probably wouldn't, if it would run for longer.


INITIAL NOTES:

rmlint -g .


rdfind .
rdfind -makesymlinks true .

-sleep Xms
    Sleeps X milliseconds between reading each file, to reduce load. Default is 0 (no sleep). Note that only a few values are supported at present: 0,1-5,10,25,50,100 milliseconds. 
    
    -deleteduplicates true|false
    Delete (unlink) files. Default is false.
    
    -checksum md5|sha1|sha256|sha512|xxh128
    What type of checksum to be used: md5, sha1, sha256, sha512 or xxh128. The default is sha1 since version 1.4.0. xxh128 is a very fast checksum, but not of cryptographic quality. xxh support is optional and requires that rdfind was configured with --with-xxhash. In case xxh is used but there is no support, an error is returned.

  TO BENCHMARK DISK PARTITION  -- hdparm (sudo apt install hdparm)
  
  - ls /dev to check if the partition was under this directory, and it was, so I wrote:
  sudo hdparm -tv /dev/nvme0n1p6 to run the command that tested read speeds. I repeated the process 3 times (results in figure below).
  
  
RESULTS: BIGGER DATASET WENT FROM 124.9 GB to 101.2 GB.
