This project evaluates, compares, and improves modern open-source data deduplication tools and algorithms. It analyzes how different chunking and indexing strategies affect performance, storage savings, memory usage, and scalability. It benchmarks open-source tools on large datasets and implements a targeted optimization in a deduplication engine to demonstrate practical contribution.
